# Business Card

A small business card app written in Kotlin using the Jetpack Compose API for Android alone. 

The details of the entire user can be changed in [strings.xml](https://github.com/bsod2528/business_card/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml). More information can also be added by adding the required composables.
